	<p>All of the event handlers now work. I still need level ideas. I want to work on some sort of verification of level completion script, but I need to see some levels first to figure out the best approach. Max, I can do the CSS if you would like. Do you guys think that it would be worthwhile for me to write a method to detect if two elements intersect? </p>
